# DisasQA
Idea for codefundo++
- DisasQA is a platform for information about Natural Disasters.
- It contains blogs and Questions and Answers related to Natural Disaster.
- Anyone can contribute their knowledge or acquire some knowledge from here.
- Also, it has a feature of security warning which will tell us about any predicted natural disaster.
- This will help in getting people know more about Natural Disasters and also shring of knowledge about them.
- And by the medium of blog views of anyone can be expressed in the community.
- I will use HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend development of this Web-App and Node.js and MySQL or MongoDB for backend purpose.
- I will add basic functions like adding a question and adding an answer to a existing question.
- Blogs will have a separate section.
- Each user will have his/her own id and password and there will be no anonynimity.
- It will ask for a question and add it to the database and under the answer section, it will show the existing questions.
- If a user wants to search about some topic then the search results will show the existing questions and blogs related to the search.
